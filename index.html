		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>My name is Ye Fon Ho. I was born in Manhattan, New York, but I grew up in a small town in North Jersey called Pompton Lakes. I have two sisters, one older and one younger. The older one attends Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, majoring in fashion design.</p>
		<p>Growing up, music was a big part of my life. I sang tenor in the choirs and played most of the brass instruments. I started with the trumpet in elementary school and throughout high school, I played the baritone, the euphonium, the trombone, the tuba, and the trumpet for different ensembles. For senior year, I was also the brass captian for the marching band. Aside from music, taekwondo was also a big part of my life. I started when I was seven years old and continued for almost ten years. I taught as well as took classes. I reached the rank of second degree black belt and junior instructor before I left. My greatest achievement in taekwondo was winning a gold medal at the 2014 ATU National Taekwondo Championships.</p>
		<p>My sophomore year, I also joined the tennis team and played through my senior year. I did not put that much time into the sport, so it was more of a hobby to me. Other hobbies of mine include playing <a class="hidden" href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/">League of Legends</a> with my friends and watching Netflix (or just television in general). My favorite ongoing shows on Netflix are BoJack Horseman, Orange is The New Black, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.</p>
		<p>I did very well in high school. I finished in the top ten of my class and got high honor roll almost every semester. I was not very sure of what I wanted to do in my future, but I knew it was something computer related. Living in a small town, the high school did not offer any computer-related courses, so I would be going into college with no prior computing knowledge. I decided to choose computer science as my major and RIT as my school, but, unfortunately, my success in high school did not translate very well into college.</p>
		<p>My first year at RIT was not a very pleasant experience. I did not do well in many of my first semester classes and ended up having to withdraw from my computer science course. Second semester, I decided to change the focus of my courses to accounting. My grades definitely were better that semester, but I also found out that I most certainly did not enjoy accounting. After a talk with my academic advisor, I decided to shift back into computing with the web and mobile major.</p>
		<p>On the more positive side, I did enjoy being a part of the RIT Pep Band and the RIT Singers during my first year. In the pep band, I played the trombone, and in the choir, I sang the tenor part. I also met some people and joined their team for some on campus League of Legends tournaments. I intend to be a part of the same groups this year.</p>
		<p>This will be my second year at RIT. I know that I cannot keep bouncing between majors, so I will have to stay with Web and Mobile Computing. So far, I am enjoying this course very much, so hopefully, I will be able to stick with this major and eventually graduate.</p>
